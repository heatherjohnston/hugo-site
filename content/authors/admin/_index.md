I am a Rackham Merit Fellow and graduate student in Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan. I currently serve as a Graduate Student Instructor for Statistics 306: Introduction to Statistical Computing. In addition, my team and I are conducting research on natural language processing with applications in using Twitter data to understand attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines.

My core values include environmental justice, social justice, and equity. I have taken inspiration from the excellent work of philosophers like Peter Singer, and seek opportunities in the spaces of global health, climate change mitigation, and effective altruism. 

I endeavor to have “[strong opinions, weakly held](**<https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/>**)." To me, this means that I don’t shy away from taking a bold stance, but I remain open to new evidence and the views of others and am ready to revise my worldview constantly.
